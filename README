Paper Manager
=============

This program provides a viewer for image files such as pdf, jpeg and
its own variant of PaperPort's .max file format.


Features
--------

- simple GUI based around stacks and pages
- view previews and browse through pages
- move pages in and out of stacks
- navigate through directories
- move stacks between directories
- double click to view full size page image (also on right pane)
- print stacks and pages, including page annotations
- full undo/redo


new in 0.4:
- basic scanning
- partial creation of .max files (but monochrome images are uncompressed)
       (also it doesn't create greyscale/colour previews)


new in 0.5:
- better scanning, should now work properly with SANE and most scanners
- stacking/unstacking, moving files between directories, etc.
- colour previews are created (greyscale still not sorry)
- PDF, JPEG and TIFF conversion supported. Results may vary
- View quality menu to trade speed for quality


new in 0.7:
- better multithreaded scanning
- undo/redo
- better PDF support
- preview panes
- OCR engine
- zooming in and out in preview windows (hold down control and use
     mouse wheel)
- rewritten for QT4
- many many other changes and improvements


new in 0.7.1:
- a few bug fixes


new in 0.8
- first github release
- new icon
- cleaned up README


Future Features
---------------

Here's what I'd like it to support:

- more operations on images
- support for more image types (at the moment only JPEG is supported)

If you have other ideas then feel free to let me know on the mailing list.


Building
--------

You will need these packages:

- libqt4-dev

QT4.4 is needed. This is available in various distributions since late 2008.

- libpoppler-qt4-dev

Used for PDF preview

- libpodofo-dev

podofo used to be embedded within the code, but is now available in a 
library. This is used for PDF operations.

- libsane-dev

This is the sane scanner library.

- libtiff4-dev

This is the tiff library

- cmake

This is needed to build podofo



To prepare on Debian or Ubuntu:

   sudo apt-get install qtcreator g++ qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libpoppler-qt4-dev libsane-dev libtiff4-dev cmake libpodofo-dev

For Red Hat / Centos you will try some other approach similar to the above.


To build:

   qmake paperman.pro
   make


But if you have QT3 installed:

$ qmake -v
Qmake version: 1.07a (Qt 3.3.8b)
Qmake is free software from Trolltech ASA.


then you will need to force QT4:

   qmake-qt4 paperman.pro
   make
